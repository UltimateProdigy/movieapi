I'm pleased to share that I've successfully completed the HNG Stage 2 task, delivering a web application that, while responsive to a certain extent, offers an engaging user experience. This application harnesses the power of Axios to interact with the TMDB database, allowing me to fetch and display a wealth of movie data, including crucial details like titles, runtimes, and other relevant information, as specified in the task requirements.

It's worth noting that while the website is not fully responsive, it does provide a level of responsiveness that ensures accessibility across a range of devices and screen sizes. This is an area I plan to further refine in future iterations to deliver an even more polished and versatile user experience.

One of the highlights of this project is the thoughtful consideration given to user experience. While data is being retrieved, I've implemented a spinner that serves as a visual loader, ensuring that users are aware of ongoing processes, contributing to a more polished and user-friendly interface.

Moreover, to enhance the visual appeal and organization of the displayed movie information, I opted for a grid layout, aligning with the layout preference specified for the task. This choice not only improves the aesthetics of the application but also optimizes the user's ability to scan and engage with the content seamlessly.

The data test id was also added to the required tags.

Thanks
